Focus on:

## Business Impact
- What problem does this solve?
- What is the expected value/ROI?
- What competitive advantage does it provide?

## Risk Assessment
- What are the biggest risks?
- What is the probability and impact of each?
- What mitigation strategies are proposed?

## Timeline & Resources
- What is the estimated effort?
- What dependencies could cause delays?
- What team/skills are required?

## Success Criteria
- How will we know this succeeded?
- What metrics will we track?
- What is the rollback plan?

Keep the summary to 1-2 pages. Avoid technical jargon.
Use bullet points for scanability.`,

	"implementer": `Summarize this specification for an **implementation-focused developer**.

Focus on:

## Technical Requirements
- What exact functionality must be built?
- What interfaces must be exposed?
- What data structures are involved?

## Constraints
- What performance requirements exist?
- What compatibility requirements exist?
- What security requirements must be met?

## Dependencies
- What external services are required?
- What internal APIs are consumed?
- What libraries or frameworks are mandated?

## Edge Cases
- What error handling is specified?
- What boundary conditions are defined?
- What undefined behavior exists?

## Implementation Hints
- What architecture patterns are suggested?
- What trade-offs have already been decided?
- What is explicitly out of scope?

Be precise and actionable. Include specific values, formats, and constraints.`,

	"qa": `Summarize this specification for a **QA engineer**.

Focus on:

## Test Surface
- What features need to be tested?
- What user journeys are critical?
- What integration points exist?

## Acceptance Criteria
For each feature:
- What does "done" look like?
- What is the expected behavior?
- What are the success metrics?

## Edge Cases & Boundaries
- What input boundaries exist?
- What error conditions should be tested?
- What race conditions are possible?

## Test Data Requirements
- What test data is needed?
- What test environments are required?
- What mocks or stubs are necessary?

## Regression Risks
- What existing functionality could break?
- What areas need extra coverage?
- What has historically been buggy?

Organize by testability. Flag areas that are hard to test.`,
