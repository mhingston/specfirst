# Traceability Mapping Prompt

{{- template "prompt-contract.md" . -}}

---

## PURPOSE

For each section of this specification, create a traceability mapping.

---

## For Each Spec Section

### 1. Identify Code Modules Affected
- Which files, packages, or modules implement this section?
- Which functions or classes are directly involved?
- Which configuration or infrastructure is required?

### 2. Note Implementation Coverage
- Is this section fully implemented, partially implemented, or not started?
- What aspects are implemented vs. planned?
- Are there any commented-out or feature-flagged implementations?

### 3. Identify Missing Coverage
- What spec requirements have no corresponding code?
- What implicit requirements are not implemented?
- What error cases are not handled?

### 4. Identify Dead or Obsolete Code Risks
- What code exists that no longer maps to current spec?
- What code was built for removed requirements?
- What technical debt is linked to spec changes?

### 5. Assess Change Impact
If this spec section changes, what would be affected?
- Direct code changes required
- Dependent components that would need updates
- Tests that would need modification
- Documentation that would become stale

## Output Format

Provide a table or structured list mapping each spec section to:
| Spec Section | Primary Code Location | Coverage Status | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------|
| ...          | ...                  | ...             | ...   |

Also flag:
- 🔴 **Not Implemented**: Spec exists but no code
- 🟡 **Partially Implemented**: Some coverage gaps
- 🟢 **Fully Implemented**: Complete coverage
- ⚫ **Obsolete Code**: Code exists but spec removed

## Output Format Constraints
CRITICAL: You must output ONLY the table and the flags.
- Do NOT include any introductory text, preamble, conversational filler, or conclusion.
- Do NOT include markdown code block fences (```markdown ... ```) around the content.
- Start directly with the content.
