## Task
Synthesize the verified findings into a final, actionable review report.

## Output Requirements

Create `review-report.md` with:

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Overall Quality Grade**: (A-F)
- **Major Risks**: Top 2-3 critical items.
- **Pass/Fail**: Based on the Definition of Done in `scope.md`.

### 2. Actionable Findings (Verified)
Grouped by severity (Sev0-Sev3). 
- Include file, identifier, description, and proposed fix for each.

### 3. Review Coverage
- Which modules were thoroughly reviewed?
- Which areas were excluded or had "No Findings"?

### 4. Next Steps
- What should the developer do first?
- Are there any unanswered questions that need manual verification?

## Guidelines
- **Convergence**: This report marks the end of the review cycle. 
- **Clarity**: Ensure fixes are copy-pasteable where appropriate.

## Output Format Constraints
CRITICAL: You must output ONLY the raw markdown content for the file.
- Start directly with the markdown content.
