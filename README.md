# SpecFirst

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/mhingston/specfirst)

SpecFirst is a Go CLI for specification-driven workflows that focuses on **prompt quality, clarity, and human judgment**.

**Why SpecFirst?**
Ambiguity is the enemy of automated coding. SpecFirst exists to bridge the gap between vague human intent and precise AI execution. It provides a structured, file-centric protocol for communicating with LLMs, ensuring that requirements are clear, context is substantial, and humans remain in control of the creative process.

## What SpecFirst Is

- **Protocol-Driven**: Workflows are defined in `protocol.yaml` files, making them versionable and reproducible.
- **Staged Execution**: Complex tasks are broken down into logical stages (e.g., Scope -> Spec -> Implementation -> Review).
- **Template-Based**: Prompts are rendered from declarative Markdown templates, ensuring consistency.
- **Artifact-Centric**: Every stage produces tangible artifacts (files) that serve as the input for the next stage.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Designed to augment human reasoning, not replace it. You review and approve artifacts at each step.

## What SpecFirst Is Not

- **Not an Agent**: It does not execute code, run terminals, or make decisions for you. It prepares the context for you (or an agent) to act.
- **Not a Sandbox**: It runs in your shell. It does not provide an isolated execution environment.
- **Not a Test Framework**: While it can help write tests, it replaces neither unit tests nor integration tests.
- **Not Magic**: It requires you to articulate your intent clearly in the templates and inputs.

## Quick Start
Get up and running with a single copy/paste flow:

```bash
# 1. Install & Initialize
specfirst init

# 2. Run the "requirements" example
# Generates a prompt, pipes it to your clipboard (macos pbcopy)
specfirst requirements | pbcopy

# Optional: bundle extra code context for an LLM
specfirst bundle requirements --file "src/**" --report-json - | pbcopy

# 3. Paste into your LLM to get requirements.md content
# ... (User Action: Paste result into requirements.md) ...

# 4. Complete the stage
specfirst complete requirements ./requirements.md

# 5. See your result
ls -l .specfirst/artifacts/
```

## Harness Support (Simplified Workflow)

You can configure SpecFirst to automatically run your prompt through an external CLI tool (like `claude` or `opencode`), removing the need to pipe output manually.

**1. Configure your harness in `.specfirst/config.yaml`:**

```yaml
harness: claude
harness_args: "--verbose"
```

**2. Run a stage directly:**

```bash
# SpecFirst runs the prompt through the harness and streams the response to stdout
specfirst requirements > requirements.md
```

**3. Use `--dry-run` to see the prompt instead:**

```bash
specfirst requirements --dry-run
```

## Repository Layout
A standard SpecFirst project looks like this:

- `.specfirst/`
    - `artifacts/`: Stored outputs from completed stages (hashed and versioned).
    - `protocols/`: Your workflow definitions (e.g., `feature.yaml`, `bugfix.yaml`).
- `templates/`: Markdown templates for your prompts (e.g., `requirements.md`, `plan.md`).
- `protocol.yaml`: The default workflow definition for the project.
- `inputs/`: (Optional) Context files or static inputs for your workflows.
